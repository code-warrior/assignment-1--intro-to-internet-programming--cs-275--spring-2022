    <div><h3 id="Rule-1">Rule 1</h3>
    <p>Is innovative. The possibilities for progression are not, by any means, exhausted.
       Technological development is always offering new opportunities for original designs.
       But imaginative design always develops in tandem with improving technology, and can
       never be an end in itself. </p></div>
    <div><a href="#top">top</a></div>

  <div><h3 id="Rule-2">Rule 2</h3>
    <p>A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy not only functional, but also
      psychological and aesthetic criteria. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a
      product whilst disregarding anything that could detract from it.</p></div>
    <div><a href="#top">top</a></div>

  <div>  <h3 id="Rule-3">Rule 3</h3>
    <p>Is aesthetic. The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because
      products are used every day and have an effect on people and their well-being. Only
      well-executed objects can be beautiful.</p></div>
    <div><a href="#top">top</a></div>

    <div><h3 id="Rule-4">Rule 4</h3>
    <p>Makes a product understandable. It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can
      make the product clearly express its function by making use of the user’s intuition. At best,
      it is self-explanatory.</p></div>
    <div><a href="#top">top</a></div>

    <div><h3 id="Rule-5">Rule 5</h3>
    <p>Is unobtrusive. Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative
       objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to
       leave room for the user’s self-expression.</p></div>
    <div><a href="#top">top</a></div>

    <div><h3 id="Rule-6">Rule 6</h3>
    <p>Is honest. It does not make a product appear more innovative, powerful or valuable than it
      really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.</p></div>
    <div><a href="#top">top</a></div>

    <div><h3 id="Rule-7">Rule 7</h3>
    <p>Is long-lasting. It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike
       fashionable design, it lasts many years — even in today’s throwaway society.</p></div>
    <div><a href="#top">top</a></div>

    <div><h3 id="Rule-8">Rule 8</h3>
    <p>Is thorough down to the last detail. Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and
      accuracy in the design process show respect towards the consumer.</p></div>
    <div><a href="#top">top</a></div>

    <div><h3 id="Rule-9">Rule 9</h3>
    <p>Is environmentally friendly. Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of
      the environment. It conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout
      the lifecycle of the product.</p></div>
    <div><a href="#top">top</a></div>

    <div><h3 id="Rule-10">Rule 10</h3>
    <p>Is as little design as possible. Less, but better — because it concentrates on the essential
      aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity.</p></div>
